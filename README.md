## What it does
Very basic code checking if a message has a string of characters in the right way, then if it does it deletes the message.
## License
I am using the [Share alike license](https://github.com/maxistheadmin/Galaxy-of-Design-Bot/blob/master/License.md).
## Contact Information
Add me on Discord `Max Thakur#0831`, or make a issue and I'll get around to fixing it as this is a semi-dead project!
